Our primary goal is simple: Create a fun, challenging environment to practice the short game.

### Specific Targets
1. **Three distinct green complexes**.
2. **One pot bunker**.
3. **Low maintenance** design (as much as possible).

We want this to be a place where friends can come over, grab a wedge, and have a beer.
